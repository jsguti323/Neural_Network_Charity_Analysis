# Neural Network Charity Analysis


## Overview
Alphabet Soup is a non-profit, philthropic foundation dedicated to helping organziations that protect the environment, improve people's well-being, and unify the world. To ensure the foundation's money is being used effectively, we will analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. Using a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years, we will create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the foundation.
